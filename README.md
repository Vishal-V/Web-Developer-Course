# Web-Development
This repository contains all the projects I've made to practice my web development skills. They include:
1. A static clone of the BBC News Website
2. A Javascript game that checks your reaction speed
3. A responsive tourist site 
4. An online form for sign up and logging in
5. An online code editor for HTML, CSS and JS that renders the code in real-time!
